# SMM-with-Spark-Streaming

Recent times have seen remarkable increase in number of mobile devices connected to the Internet and a variety of uses based on their location data have come into existence. This increase in number necessitates a scalable map-matching solution to meet the ever-increasing demand. Map Matching is the problem of how to match recorded geographic coordinates to a logical model of the real world. Thereby, measured GPS coordinates are matched onto a reference coordinate system (e.g. a map). The existing solutions for map matching do not scale and therefore are no suitable for Big Data. This project is mainly based on research conducted by Newson & Krumm and Mattheis et al. Based on the above, this project is aimed at developing a map matching application that runs on Apache Spark Streaming, where the map matching is done at scale and in a streaming fashion. 

This project is based on BMWCarIT's Barefoot library.
